# React Intro

## Prerequisites

1. Work through the React [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html) guide
1. Read this [props vs state](https://github.com/uberVU/react-guide/blob/master/props-vs-state.md) guide, making sure to understand the differences between a React component's props and state

### What is React?

The *view*! While it can be much more, React.JS is really just an JS library providing a view for data rendered as HTML.

React is simply an implementation of Web Components, the upcoming standard for custom HTML5 user interface elements

React components should be compared to AngularJS directives

Virtual DOM

React keeps two copies of a virtual DOM (the original and updated versions). These two virtual DOM trees are passed into a React function that diffs them and a stream of DOM operations are returned (generally these operations involve setting a property on an element).

The Shadow DOM feature of Web Components allows us to encapsulate DOM and CSS as a single element on the page. The canonical example of this is the video element in HTML which when looked at in the Chrome web browser with its Shadow DOM feature enabled shows the complex set of HTML elements that make up the implementation of the element, not just a <video> tag.

React makes no assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, it’s easy to try it out on a small feature in an existing project.” So React can be used with other JavaScript MVC Frameworks by plugging it into a given framework’s web Component technology (Directives in AngularJS, Components in Ember, and smaller item views in Backbone).
